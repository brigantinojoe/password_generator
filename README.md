# Password Generator

## Description
Passwords are always a point of contention. Do you create the same password for multiple sites? Do you create a slightly different password for each site with a general password convention? Where do you think of your passwords? Are they secure enough? Look no further, the password generator will ask you what you're looking for and create a customzied password based your requested criteria. 

I learned that using Math.Random() alongside the Math.Floor() functions allow you to generate a lot of random values. Although I'm not quite there, I can only imagine how useful that is when creating educational material, games, and playful websites.
